## Abstract
The analysis of the urban areas is a very trend topic which covers different research fields such as: computer vision and natural language processing. In the last years, social network becomes a very huge and reliable repository for information about points of interest; each point is described from users through natural language description such as reviews or using fixed labels to categorize the point. In this paper we will investigate the use of a word2vec model to classify the predominant land use of the urban area of Manhattan using POIs categories from Foursquare. The results are then compared with other methods based on various machine learning classifiers and from methods from the state of the art.
